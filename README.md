# Patientor Frontend

This app is further developed from [fullstack-hy2020/patientor](https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/patientor) as part of exercises in [part 9](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part9) of the Full Stack open course.

### Backend

The backend developed in the course can be found [here](https://github.com/rheikkinen/fs-typescript/tree/main/patientor).

### Getting started

- To get the app running just install its dependencies with `npm install` and run it with `npm run dev`.
- The app should work without a backend, but make sure that the request made to `/api/ping` made on startup is successful before continuing.
